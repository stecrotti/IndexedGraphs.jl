IndexedGraphs.jl
====

This package defines three basic types of Graphs:

- [IndexedGraph](@ref)
- [IndexedDiGraph](@ref)
- [IndexedBiDiGraph](@ref)

In addition, it provides a [BipartiteIndexedGraph](@ref) type.

They all comply with the [Developing Alternate Graph Types](https://juliagraphs.org/Graphs.jl/dev/developing/) rules for subtyping from `Graphs.AbstractGraph`.
